A dog named Teddy went on a walk.
 Teddy is a super fluffy dog with brown curly hair.
Teddy has a bright red color.
Teddy's favorite toy is his bone.

So, when he went on a walk, he brought along his bone and people watched him with interest. Some of them stopped him and his owner and pet Teddy. He liked that a lot. His owner was also happy that other people liked Teddy.
	
Teddy keeps growing. He already surpassed the normal size for a dog of his kind, so they took him to the vet to see if anything was wrong. Unbeknownst to the owners, Teddy has a rare gene that blocks the chemical which halts his growth once he reaches a certain size. Even a week after they had discovered this, Teddy continued to grow and grow until the leash he had no longer fit him. Sadly enough, his favorite bone was soon outgrown as well and the owners had to buy a larger bone for Teddy.
